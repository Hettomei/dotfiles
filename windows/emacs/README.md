Where this file must goes in windows ?

For the moment, only works in emacs 27 stable, not on emacs 28 snapshot

Must go there.

C:\Users\tim\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d\init.el

If you already run emacs, it is possible that a file exist, you must delete it at : 

C:\Users\tim\AppData\Roaming\.emacs


Then run emacs and wait the first time it downloads everythings
